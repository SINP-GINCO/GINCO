Sprint 17 update script expects to have the geofla data in this directory. 
But this is not a good practice to store referentials in the git and github 
rejected them. This is the reason why the data are not presents here anymore.

If you realy want to make the script works you shoud get the geofla data
and copy them here in a GEOFLA_5.1 directory.
